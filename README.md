# Unity VRoid Free Invector 3D Character Controller
This project is a demonstration on how easy it is to use VRoid model with Invector Character Controller. This project uses Unity version 2021.2.3f1, earlier versions of Unity might not work. Keep in mind that this controller uses the Old Input System. To change it, Go to Edit > Project Settings > Player. In "Configuration", select Active Input Handling and change "Input Manager (Old)" to "Both". If you can't find it, you can search for it with the search box on the project settings window.

Huge credit to these guys who made this possible!

You don't need detailed instructions to use this controller on your VRoid model. But if you want to start fresh, you can just create a basic 3D project from Unity Hub, import the Character Controller Starter Assets and 3rd Person Controller asset from Unity Asset Store, then import UniVRM plugin and your character. If you don't know how to import your VRoid character to Unity, I have a tutorial about it in here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrIn9wRYqUI
